## One Thing

What is the One Thing you can do to make today a success? This web app helps you to set that thing in your sights and complete it. Built with React, it provides a polished front-end experience for all screen sizes. Local Storage records your past accomplishments and allows you to be notified of multi-day streaks, all without the need to log in.

### How to Use

Enter the one thing you want to get done into the open field, then press enter to set it in your sights. Complete and cancel buttons will then appear. Once you have completed the task of the day, click the green check box to record your victory. Click cancel to clear the field and enter something else. Don't worry if you don't complete your task the same day that you enter it; you can come back anytime and complete it by checking the history area. Btw, the history menu shows all previous tasks that you have entered. Pretty simple, huh?
